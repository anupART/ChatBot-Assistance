give me 5  movie recommendation,"Sure, here are five movies that I'd recommend:

1. The Wolf of Wall Street - This is a biographical black comedy about stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who rises to great wealth on Wall Street.

2. The Big Short - This movie is based on the true story of a group of investors who predicted the 2008 housing market collapse.

3. The Founder - This is a biographical drama about Ray Kroc, who turned a small fast food restaurant called McDonald's into a global franchise empire.

4. The Intern - This is a comedy-drama about a retired executive who becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site, and develops a relationship with the founder of the company.

5. Wall Street - This classic drama is about a young stockbroker who is taken under the wing of a successful but unscrupulous corporate raider.",,,2023-04-20 10:17:05.350575
